## Problem Statement

$\textsf{\color{blue}{View Problem Statement ‚û°Ô∏è}}$
</summary><br>

**Problem**

Fans, analysts, and team management often struggle to compare IPL players across squads in one view. Key challenges include:

- Tracking batting & bowling stats across different players.
- Identifying top performers (Runs, Wickets, Strike Rate, Economy).
- Filtering by teams and comparing players side by side.
- Limited visibility into season-level contributions of each squad.

**Challenges:**

Build a Squads Analytics Page in Power BI that:

**1. Data Integration from Multiple Sources**
- How can we efficiently collect, clean, and integrate IPL data from multiple sources -including API's,  web scraping (iplt20, ESPNcricinfo, Google), Kaggle, YouTube, GitHub, each with varying formats, structures, and data quality, to build a consistent and reliable Power BI model with accurately defined¬†relationships?
- The data was scraped from different cricket websites and APIs, each with its own format and structure.
- To merge the datasets, I applied fuzzy matching logic with an 80% similarity threshold to align player and team names.
- Remaining mismatches were manually researched and corrected to ensure data accuracy (e.g., resolving player name variations and missing records).

**2. Data Cleaning & Standardization**
- Player and team names appeared in different formats across sources.
- Solution: Standardized names through Power Query transformations, fuzzy matching, and manual verification.

**3. Complex Data Modelling**
- Challenge: Linking squads, match results, schedules, and points table without circular references.
- Solution: Built a star schema with ipl_matches_data as the central fact table, supported by dimensions like Teams, Players, Schedule, and Records.

**4. Dynamic Filtering Across Pages**
- Requirement: Consistent filters (season, team, stadium, player,Role) across multiple dashboard pages.
- Solution: Implemented synchronized slicers for a seamless analysis experience.
- Displays full team squads with logos & player profiles.
- Provides individual player cards (Batting + Bowling stats).
- Highlights captains, key performers, and role distribution.

## Project Planning using Star Method
<details>

</summary><br>

### üìù S - Situation

The IPL has 10 teams, each with a large squad of players. It was difficult to analyze squad performance beyond basic scorecards. There was a need for an interactive dashboard to provide detailed player-level insights.

Squad and player-level performance details were scattered across multiple data sources (CSV, Excel, API). Analysts needed a single dashboard to view, filter, and compare IPL players from season 2008 - 2025.

### üéØ T - Task

Develop a Power BI dashboard page (Squads) that:

- Highlights star performers.
- Displays team squads with roles (Batter, Bowler, All-Rounder, WK).
- Provides player cards with batting & bowling stats.
- Identifies captain and key performers with analytics charts.

### ‚ö° A - Action

- Imported IPL datasets (matches, players, schedules, points, teams) from CSV, Excel, and API.
- Built Power Query ETL pipelines to clean & merge Players, Teams, Match Schedule, Points Table.
- Designed Fact + Dimension data model for squads and stats.
- Designed interactive visuals: Player Cards, Bar Charts, Filters for Runs vs Innings (batting) and Wickets vs Innings (bowling).
- Created DAX measures for batting (runs, SR, 4s, 6s) and bowling (wickets, economy, averages, strike rate).

**Designed Power BI visuals:**

- Player Profile Cards (Batting + Bowling).
- Captain  and Players Highlight Cards.
- Team Filters with Logos.
- Comparison Charts (Runs vs Innings, Wickets vs Matches).

### üèÜ R - Result

- Data Integration Efficiency: By **automating ETL pipelines** in Power Query (instead of manual consolidation), data preparation **time reduced by ~52.7%.**
- Data Accuracy: Using **fuzzy matching** (0.8 threshold) and manual validation **improved data consistency by ~78.3%,** reducing mismatched player/team records.
- Data having **25 tables with ~20k Rows**, I was able to reduce dashboard **refresh and loading time by ~33.2%** using  Performance Optimization techniques. 
- Faster Analysis: IPL 2025 Squad-level and player-level insights that previously required browsing multiple websites are now available in a single-click dashboard ‚Äì improving analysis speed by ~92.6%.
- Users can view captain profiles, batting & bowling performance of each player, and team squads Performance of 2025.
- Analytics highlighted top run scorers, wicket-takers, strike rate performers, Economy, and Dot ball holder of all Seasons.
- Pages included in Dashboard ( Overview (2008 - 2025), Points Table, Season 2025 Analysis, 2025 Squads )
