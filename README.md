## Problem Statement
<details>
<summary>
$\textsf{\color{blue}{View Problem Statement ‚û°Ô∏è}}$
</summary><br>

**Problem**

Fans, analysts, and team management often struggle to compare IPL players across squads in one view. Key challenges include:

- Tracking batting & bowling stats across different players.

- Identifying top performers (Runs, Wickets, Strike Rate, Economy).

- Filtering by teams and comparing players side by side.

- Limited visibility into season-level contributions of each squad.

**Challenges:**

Build a Squads Analytics Page in Power BI that:

- Displays full team squads with logos & player profiles.

- Provides individual player cards (Batting + Bowling stats).

- Allows filtering by team / player / role.

- Highlights captains, key performers, and role distribution.

$\textsf{\color{blue}{View Stratergy ‚û°Ô∏è}}$
</summary><br>

### üìù S - Situation

The IPL has 10 teams, each with a large squad of players. It was difficult to analyze squad performance beyond basic scorecards. There was a need for an interactive dashboard to provide detailed player-level insights.

Squad and player-level performance details were scattered across multiple data sources (CSV, Excel, API). Analysts needed a single dashboard to view, filter, and compare IPL players from season 2008 - 2025.

### üéØ T - Task

Develop a Power BI dashboard page (Squads) that:

- Displays team squads with roles (Batter, Bowler, All-Rounder, WK).

- Provides player cards with batting & bowling stats.

- Allows comparison of players across teams with filters.

- Identifies captain and key performers with analytics charts.

- Highlights captains and star performers with analytics charts

### ‚ö° A - Action

- Imported IPL datasets (matches, players, schedules, points, teams) from CSV, Excel, and API.

- Built Power Query ETL pipelines to clean & merge Players, Teams, Match Schedule, Points Table.

- Designed Fact + Dimension data model for squads and stats.

- Designed interactive visuals: Player Cards, Bar Charts, Filters for Runs vs Innings (batting) and Wickets vs Innings (bowling).

- Created DAX measures for batting (runs, SR, 4s, 6s) and bowling (wickets, economy, averages, strike rate).

Designed Power BI visuals:

- Player Profile Cards (Batting + Bowling).

- Captain Highlight Card.

- Team Filters with Logos.

- Comparison Charts (Runs vs Innings, Wickets vs Matches).

### üèÜ R - Result

- Users can view captain profiles, batting & bowling performance, and team squads Performances also.

- Analytics highlighted top run scorers, wicket-takers, strike rate performers, Economy, and Dot ball holder of all Season. 

- Batting & Bowling stats available for each player, with team filters.

- Analysts and fans can compare squads across 10 IPL teams instantly.

- Allowed fans, coaches, and analysts to compare players and squads across seasons.

- Positioned the Squads Page as the analytics hub alongside Points Table, Match Schedule, and Overview pages.
